  It's believed that Japan and Denmark have a more fair income distribution. Because in the past ten years, the Gini Coefficient in Japan has been floating around 0.27. and it is worth reminding that Japan is one of the developed countries which have the lowest Gini Coefficient.
2.Learning About Imperialism
  To be honest, I'm not interested in history because in most history articals, the author always shows their sympathy for the victims and criticizes the imperialism.
